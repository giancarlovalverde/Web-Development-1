                <h1>Welcome! Ready to guess the seasons?</h1>
                <p>In this game, you'll try to guess the correct season based on clues.</p>
                <p>You have 2 attempts per question; if you guess wrong twice, you won't get any points for that question :/</p> 
                <p>Each question comes with a unique round ID to make it funnier! :D</p>
                <p>If you wish to end the game, click "Cancel," and your total score will be displayed!</p>
